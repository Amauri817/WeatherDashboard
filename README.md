# Weather Dashboard

## Description 
External APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in their context, frequently consuming this data via a server.

Your Challenge this week is to build a weather dashboard application that calls the OpenWeather API and renders data in the browser.
